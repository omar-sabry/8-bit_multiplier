The projectâ€™s objective is to design a model for an 8x8 bit signed sequential multiplier using Verilog and implement it on the Basys 3 FPGA board. We
started out by drawing a block diagram that contains all the hardware we will use to in order to implement this multiplier. The block diagram is
separated into two parts: data path and control unit.
